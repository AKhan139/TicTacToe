# TicTacToe ReadMe
Team Beard's Tic Tac Toe program.

Welcome to the repo Team Beard's TicTacToe project for Comp 330 with Professor William Honig.

Principal project development was done by Neal McMahon in Java. Abdur Khan was responsible for testing and supplementary project requirements.

The project consists of a graphical tic-tac-toe game with two players as X's and O's. We used JFrame so we could customize the user interface and general graphical representation of the game.
The project runs on two classes, Main and TicTacToeFrame. Project requirements we fulfilled were:

1. Standard 3x3 grid for tic-tac-toe
2. Generation of messages for players (e.g. X's turn to go, O's turn to go)
3. Messages displaying game state upon win or tie.

To view a demo of the project and an overview of the code, watch the video on [Basecamp](https://3.basecamp.com/3842445/buckets/8943131/uploads/1308085106).
